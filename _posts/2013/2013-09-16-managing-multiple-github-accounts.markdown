Let's look at how to manage multiple Github accounts from one computer. In essence, it's simply a matter of balancing both your git and ssh configurations - which actually is not as bad as it might seem.

## Set up SSH Keys

Let's assume your two Github accounts are named *githubPersonal* and *githubWork*, respectively.

Create two SSH keys, saving each to a separate file:

``` sh
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@associated_with_githubPersonal.com"
# save it as id_rsa_personal when prompted
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@associated_with_githubWork.com"
# save it as id_rsa_work when prompted
```

The above commands setup the following files:

- *id_rsa_personal*
- *id_rsa_personal.pub*
- *id_rsa_work*
- *id_rsa_work.pub*

## Add the keys to your Github accounts:

#### Copy the key to your clipboard:

``` sh
$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal.pub
```

#### Add the key to your account:
- Go to your Account Settings
- Click "SSH Keys" then "Add SSH key"
- Paste your key into the "Key" field and add a relevant title
- Click "Add key" then enter your Github password to confirm


#### Repeat the process for your *githubWork* account.

## Create a configuration file to manage the separate keys

#### Create a config file in ~/.ssh/

``` sh
$ touch config
```

#### Edit the file using the text editor of your choice. I used vim - `$ vim config`:

``` sh
# githubPersonal
Host personal
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# githubWork
Host work
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

## Update stored identities

#### Clear currently stored identities:

``` sh
$ ssh-add -D
```

#### Add new keys:

``` sh
$ ssh-add id_rsa_personal
$ ssh-add id_rsa_work
```

#### Test to make sure new keys are stored:

``` sh
$ ssh-add -l
```

#### Test to make sure Github recognizes the keys:

``` sh
$ ssh -T personal
Hi githubPersonal! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
$ ssh -T work
Hi githubWork! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```


## Test PUSH

#### On Github, create a new repo in your personal account, *githubPersonal*, called *test-personal*.

#### Back on your local machine, create a test directory:

``` sh
$ cd ~/documents
$ mkdir test-personal
$ cd test-personal
```

#### Add a blank "readme.md" file and PUSH to Github:

``` sh
$ touch readme.md
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "first commit"
$ git remote add origin git@personal:githubPersonal/test-personal.git
$ git push origin master
```

> Notice how we're using the custom account, `git@personal`, instead of `git@github.com`.

#### Repeat the process for your *githubWork* account.

## Test PULL

#### Add some text to the *readme.md* file in your personal account on Github.

#### Now PULL and merge the changes by running the following command within the *test-personal* directory:

``` sh
$ git pull origin master
```

#### Again, repeat this for your *githubWork* account.
