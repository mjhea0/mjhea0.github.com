<span class="s1">how to work with create react app?</span>

<span class="s1">## Test Setup</span>

<span class="s1">Thus far we&#39;</span>ve only tested each individual microservice with unit and integration tests. Let<span class="s1">&#39;s turn our attention to functional, e2e tests to test the entire system. For this, we&#39;</span>ll use <span class="o">[</span>TestCafe<span class="o">](</span>https://testcafe.devexpress.com/<span class="o">)</span>.

Again, add a *Dockerfile* to <span class="s2">&quot;tests&quot;</span>:
