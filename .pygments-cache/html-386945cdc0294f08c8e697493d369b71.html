## Update CSS

Your form should look much cleaner now. It&#39;s a bit bare, but you can liven it up with your own HTML. Now, let&#39;s add some changes to the CSS.

Again, since web2py uses the Twitter Bootstrap, you can make CSS changes quickly. Navigate to [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/). Here, you can find various CSS themes to play with. In this example, I&#39;m going to use Spacelab.

Now, what you need to do is view the *bootstrap.min.css* file by clicking download and then selecting the file. It should open in your browser. Copy all the text. Return to your web2py admin. Scroll down to the static files, click the CSS folder, edit the boootstrap.min.css file-

-and then delete all the current CSS and paste in the CSS that you copied before from the Spacelab theme. Refresh your form @ [http://127.0.0.1:8000/form/default/display_your_form.html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/form/default/display_your_form.html) and test it again to make sure nothing broke.

Oh - and if you want, you can edit the layout/appearance of the all_records page as well. I trust that you can figure out how to do that by now. If not - Try anyway, and if you fail, Google to find the answer. You&#39;ll learn better that way.

If all looks well, it&#39;s time to deploy!

## Deploy

I&#39;ll go over this quick since I covered this in [detail](http://mherman.org/blog/2012/11/27/crash-course-in-web2py-part-1/) in the first tutorial.

1. Go back to the admin page ([http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/site](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/site)) and click Pack All. Save the w2p-package to your computer.
1. Fire up [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
1. Once logged in, click *Web*, *Replace with a new web app*, then click the button for web2py.
1. Enter an admin password. Click Next.
1. Next, head on over to the admin interface - https://mjhea9.pythonanywhere.com/admin/default/index (don&#39;t forget to use your own user name and add the https:) - which should look familiar (it better!). Enter your password.
1. On the right side of the page, under the *Upload and install packed application section*, upload the w2p file you saved. Enter a name for your app (&quot;form&quot;). Click Install.
1. Check out your form. You can view mine at - [https://mjhea9.pythonanywhere.com/form/default/display_your_form.html](https://mjhea9.pythonanywhere.com/form/default/display_your_form.html)

Now just test it out to make sure it all works. Make sure all the errors/validators are working and then add a new record. One thing you do need to change is the default for generic view. You can read more about it [here](http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/10#Generic-views). Open up db.py and scroll down to line 28. You need to remove the if statement, so the line will look just like this:
<span class="nt">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>response.generic_patterns = [<span class="ni">&amp;lsquo;</span>*<span class="ni">&amp;rsquo;</span>]
</pre></div>
