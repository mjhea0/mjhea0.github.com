Excellent, now we<span class="s1">&#39;re really rolling! Let&#39;</span>s <span class="nb">break </span>this down before proceeding, because we<span class="s1">&#39;ll be repeating the same basic process to create and attach each of our route handlers.</span>

<span class="s1">1. Create a method on `HeroRouter` that takes the arguments of your typical Express request handler: `request`, `response`, and `next`.</span>
<span class="s1">1. Implement the server&#39;</span>s response <span class="k">for</span> the endpoint.
1. Inside of <span class="sb">`</span>init<span class="sb">`</span>, use <span class="sb">`</span>HeroRouter<span class="sb">`</span><span class="s1">&#39;s instance of the Express `Router` to attach the handler to an endpoint of the API.</span>

<span class="s1">We&#39;</span>ll follow this same workflow <span class="k">for</span> each endpoint, and can leave <span class="sb">`</span>App<span class="sb">`</span> alone. All of our <span class="sb">`</span>HeroRouter<span class="sb">`</span> endpoints will be appended to <span class="sb">`</span>/api/v1/heroes<span class="sb">`</span>. Let<span class="s1">&#39;s implement a `GET` handler that returns a single hero by the `id` property. We&#39;</span>ll <span class="nb">test </span>the endpoint by looking <span class="k">for</span> Luke Cage, who has an <span class="sb">`</span>id<span class="sb">`</span> of 1.
