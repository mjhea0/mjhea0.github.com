<div class="highlight"><pre>This config will create a container called <span class="sb">`</span>movies-db<span class="sb">`</span>, from the *Dockerfile* found in <span class="s2">&quot;services/users/src/db&quot;</span>. Once spun up, environment variables will be added and an <span class="nb">exit </span>code of <span class="sb">`</span>0<span class="sb">`</span> will be sent after it<span class="err">&#39;</span>s successfully up and running. Postgres will be available on port <span class="sb">`</span>5433<span class="sb">`</span> on the host machine and on port <span class="sb">`</span>5432<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">for</span> other services.

&gt; **NOTE:** Use <span class="sb">`</span>expose<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">if</span> you just want Postgres available to other services but not the host machine:
&gt; <span class="sb">```</span>
&gt; expose:
    - <span class="s2">&quot;5432&quot;</span>
&gt; <span class="sb">```</span>

Fire up the container:
