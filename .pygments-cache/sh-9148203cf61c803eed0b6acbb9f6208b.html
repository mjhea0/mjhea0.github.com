<div class="highlight"><pre>Here we imported <span class="sb">`</span>sqlite3<span class="sb">`</span> along with the main <span class="o">[</span>Flask application object<span class="o">](</span>http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#application-object<span class="o">)</span>, <span class="sb">`</span>Flask<span class="sb">`</span>, which creates an instance of Flask in our application. The Flask application object acts as the central object, which we can use as a way of calling our view functions, adding our URL rules, template configuration and much more. With that instance we can run the application using the <span class="sb">`</span>run<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="o">[</span>method<span class="o">](</span>http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Flask.run<span class="o">)</span>. We also <span class="nb">set </span>the <span class="o">[</span>debug flag<span class="o">](</span>http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Flask.debug<span class="o">)</span> to <span class="sb">`</span>True<span class="sb">`</span> so that the server live reloads when code changes and provides an interactive debugger when an exception is thrown.

<span class="sb">`</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="sb">`</span> states that this <span class="nb">source </span>file is our main program. Any files imported from other modules will have their name <span class="nb">set </span>to their module name. This is because you may sometimes have modules that could be executed directly as well as be imported into a main app file. This line means that the code in those modules will only execute when you want to run the module as a program, and not have it execute when someone just wants to import a module and execute it themselves.

Finally, it<span class="err">&#39;</span>s important to note that any imports must go at the top of our *app.py* file. These must come before anything <span class="k">else</span> in order to be used later on in our file.

Now, add the routes:
