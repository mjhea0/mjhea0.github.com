Iâ€™ve worked in various industries, companies large and small, wearing multiple hats. My languages/weapons of choice are Python and JavaScript. Besides development, I enjoy building financial models, tech writing, content marketing, and teaching.

Hey I'm Michael - a ginger since I was born and a Radiohead fan since I developed taste. I can't dance - though there's a video of me on YouTube giving it a try. Seinfeld is the best thing ever, made better when paired with a Colorado IPA. Ask me about the NBA sometime - I absorb what I can before I fall asleep. There's a tattoo under my t-shirt - surprise!
