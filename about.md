Current status: Co-founder / Lead Engineer at [Monitaur](https://monitaur.ai/).

--

I'm a full-stack web application developer and software architect that specializes in taking products from inception to delivery across the entire stack. I was an early adopter of Docker and the microservices design pattern. I like working on infrastructure and developer tools since it helps make other engineers more productive.

On a personal note, I'm passionate about educating and developing engineers. I co-founded [Real Python](http://www.realpython.com) (which was a successful exit) and led three cohorts teaching full-stack JavaScript at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/). I also founded [TestDriven Labs](http://testdriven.io/), a platform for mid-level engineers to learn Test-Driven Development (TDD), microservices, and AWS infrastructure.

Besides development, I enjoy running, building financial models, tech writing, content marketing, teaching, and reading well-crafted project READMEs.

Hey I'm Michael - a ginger since I was born and a Radiohead fan since I developed taste. I can't dance - though there's a video of me on YouTube giving it a try. Seinfeld is the best thing ever, made better when paired with a Colorado IPA. Ask me about the NBA sometime - I absorb what I can before I fall asleep. There's a tattoo under my t-shirt - surprise!

### Thoughts

1. *Programming languages are all different ways of expressing the same thing. A software developer should be able to understand all of them.*
1. *Open source software is free as in free house. If you want to fix or improve something, either learn to do it yourself or pay a contractor.*
1. *If you don't know how to solve a problem, start by breaking it down into small, manageable pieces. What do you need in order to solve it? What do you already know? Web developers don't need to know everything; they just need to be able to break a problem up into smaller chunks in order to find the missing information required to solve the problem at hand.*
