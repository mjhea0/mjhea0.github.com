  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial shows how to create a basic web app using the web2py framework. I came across the framework last night and literally created and deployed a web app in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>Web2py is an open source web application framework that focuses on rapid development. By placing a strong emphasis on ease of use and productivity, it&#8217;s one of the easiest frameworks to learn and use. Despite its simplicity, though, web2py is jam packed with features and is quite powerful and flexible - much like the Python language itself.</p>

<h2>Download and Run</h2>

<p>Start by downloading the <a href="http://www.web2py.com/examples/default/download">latest</a> stable release.</p>

<p>Unpack the zip, run the web2py executable file, and choose an admin password.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-25_1642.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Create an App</h2>

<p>Click the Administrative Interface link on the right side of the page-</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-25_1659.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>-and enter your password. The admin page shows your installed apps and provides an interface for creating and deploying new apps. On the right side of the page, under the <em>New simple application</em> header, type the name of a new app - in this example I used &#8220;helloWorld&#8221; - and then click Create.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-25_1704.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You will then be redirected to the design interface page. You can also view the generic page for your app at this address - <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/helloWorld">http://127.0.0.1:8000/helloWorld</a>.</p>

<h2>Edit the App</h2>

<p>Back on the  page, click the edit button next to &#8220;default.py&#8221; in the Controllers section.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-25_2035.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then change the default code for the index function to-</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-25_2046.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hit CTRL-S on your keyboard to save the changes, then refresh <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/helloWorld/default/index">http://127.0.0.1:8000/helloWorld/default/index</a> to see the changes made.</p>

<h2>Deploy the App</h2>

<p>Go back to the admin page (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/site">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/default/site</a>) and click Pack All. Save the  w2p-package to your computer.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-25_2317.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now you need to deploy the app to a cloud platform. The easiest one to use with web2py is <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a>. Go ahead and sign up. Once registered and logged in, click Web, Replace  with a new web app, and then click the button for web2py.</p>

<p>Enter an admin password, and then click Next. Once the app is setup, go to the admin interface at <a href="https://your_user_name.pythonanywhere.com/admin">https://user_name.pythonanywhere.com/admin</a> (replace user_name with your user name) and enter your admin password to log-in. Now, to create your app, go to the <em>Upload and install packed application</em> section on the right side, give your app a name (helloWorld), and finally upload the w2p-file you saved to your computer earlier. Click install.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.backwardsteps.com/uploads/2012-11-26_00141.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally, go to your homepage to view the app at   (replace user_name with your user name).</p>

<p>You just deployed your first app - congrats!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How are monopolies created? It seems weird that monopolies can still exist, but they are alive and well despite laws and regulations . With tech companies, it becomes surprisingly easy as they develop or acquire exclusive start-ups, technologies and patents. However, this normally means just temporary dominance in a certain industry until competitors catch up. A true monopoly like those of the 19th and 20th centuries arise when one company dominates every aspect of an industry. The company can then game the market forcing customers to buy their services at that the price and conditions they set. The company benefits from coordinating its services and forces out competitors that specialize or have fewer resources. In short, the company becomes the only game in town. Google faces this daunting boundary as it starts to acquire content producing companies and websites. Is it right for a search engine to also provide content when people rely on it to find content from the top providers?</p>

<h2>Google and Content Creation Not New</h2>

<p>While recent acquisitions raise the ire of consumer advocates, Google was on this path for a while. The biggest acquisition would be the purchase of the popular video website YouTube. YouTube is a veritable geyser of content creation by both professional companies and private users. Google for the time being, doesn&#8217;t really cross lines because YouTube is more of a platform for creative content than a direct source. However, certain practices on its search engine for YouTube point to possible conflicts of interest that signal a monopoly forming. For example, video results for the search engine put YouTube results before those of other media websites like Daily Motion or Veoh. This is a major problem for market competition when looking at how YouTube benefits from its integration with Google&#8217;s multi-billion dollar infrastructure. Is it fair for its competitors for YouTube to have such an advantage?</p>

<h2>From Content Finder To Content Producer</h2>

<p>The line gets more blurry as Google looks to provide its own native content for YouTube and other websites. Google recently purchased Next New Networks, a web TV production company. The company has a reputation for creating original content for online viewing producing several popular web shows and shorts. With the backing of a major company like Google and the wide reach of the YouTube platform, the company could soon compete with traditional media outlets like ABC and NBC Universal. The problem lies in how this conflicts with Google&#8217;s role as a search engine. Google could game search results to put its shows over other companies&#8217; products instead of relying on actual user response and interest. The worst part is that users could only detect something wrong after a significant period of time.</p>

<h2>Why Acquiring Content Providers Leads To Monopoly Of Search Results</h2>

<p>YouTube is a general platform. Even if Google provides content, the majority comes from other sources, even competitors like Microsoft and Apple. Google&#8217;s recent acquisition of Zagat and Frommer&#8217;s shows what happens when the company directly provides content for the search engines. Zagat and Frommer&#8217;s are sites that provide online travel guides and information. Its competitors are websites like Lonely Planet. As a subsidiary of Google, there are several ways the company can benefit on Google&#8217;s search engine. First, the site can get free sponsored adds and searches when users make relevant searches. This is the same as automatically getting to the top of the Google pages. This is unfair to competitors who have to climb the rankings the hard way through building up a following through good content and costly marketing. In essence Google could use its unfair advantage to dominate or acquire competitors in the online travel guide business. Google becomes more and more like the famous political cartoon of Standard Oil. It is an octopus with its tentacles in various web related sectors and industries using its collective advantages to push out legitimate competitors.</p>

<p>The issue is serious, and an interesting indicator of growing awareness about it was its use as a plot point in an episode of the popular Law Procedural/ Drama, The Good Wife. In a recent episode, two college students create a revolutionary voice software that a major search engine sabotages by altering the search results. The reason was they refused to sell their idea and the company buys their competitor and promotes them instead. The show raised the problem of providing direct legal evidence of the crime especially when the plaintiffs were bought out with jobs. Hopefully Google hasn&#8217;t reached that point yet, but the temptation to follow such actions eventually become irresistible.</p>

<h2>Customers May Act As Check</h2>

<p>Google is unique because its revenue <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/">comes</a> indirectly from advertising and depends on the users of its search engine and other products who see its ads. Its services are popular because customers rely on the impartiality of its algorithm to provide the most relevant content. If customers see Google tilting the board in their own favor, it could drive users to alternative search engines such as DuckDuckGo  and Bing. To avoid such scenarios Google has to follow the rules it now uses with YouTube allowing many content providers to use its new content services as a platform. This way it can maintain the separation it needs as a search engine. If not, regulators will step in and limit their actions in more detrimental ways.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2012-11-16T18:57:00-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 16<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A cohort analysis is a type of study which is mainly conducted by observation over a period of time. It works by analyzing a given group of individuals who have a trait or experience in common, within a given time. It is a great tool used in retaining customers and it is especially useful for business owners who have websites.</p>

<p>Since more visitors to the site generally translate into more business, it is important to retain these clients and monitor the regularity with which they come back.</p>

<p>The term engagement is used to describe the time that is spent accessing the product. It denotes frequency and it is essential to measure this level and analyze it as it relates to certain intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Time to first purchase or engagement (e.g. follow, post, signup)</li>
<li>% activating in first day, week, month, etc. (B2C vs. B2B)</li>
<li>Repeat rate, 2x%2B repeat rate, 3x%2B repeat rate, etc.</li>
<li>How does first purchase (or engagement proxy) impact future revenue/engagement?</li>
<li>Email Opt-out behavior or member churn</li>
</ol>


<h2><strong>Benefits of Conducting an Effective Cohort Analysis</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>Performing a cohort analysis is a highly effective method of study as it helps to separate the clients into cohorts. Thus, individuals who joined the site during a particular period are grouped together e.g. the March cohort, the April cohort and so on. This way, the analysis of their engagement and how it has changed over time, is unaffected by the individuals in other groups, thus keeping the groups completely independent of one another; and facilitating a more accurate study.</p>

<p><strong>Providing a clear distinction between Growth and Engagement</strong></p>

<p>Separating the clients into cohorts is also effective in clearly defining a difference between growth metrics and engagement metrics. These two measurements can sometimes be confused with each other as growth is the successful addition of clients who use one&#8217;s product or service. Generally, added numbers automatically increase the overall engagement but it may only be the new clients who access the website, and will probably cease to do so after a while.</p>

<p>Performing a cohort analysis therefore helps one to make a distinction between the two and as a result, the rate of growth, which may be high, does not hide any issues that may need to be addressed as far as engagement or participation and interaction with the product, is concerned. These issues are therefore identified and effectively dealt with in order to facilitate higher retention.</p>

<p><strong>Effective Comparison of data between Cohorts</strong></p>

<p>A cohort analysis also helps one to compare the results between two or more groups. For instance, if the April cohort is more engaged in the product than the March cohort, an analysis may be required on any changes that may have occurred between the two months. In addition, a further analysis may be performed on the groups themselves to see whether the product is possibly appealing to a particular set of people and not another.</p>

<h2><strong>Studying a Wide Range of Data</strong></h2>

<p>By performing a cohort analysis, it is possible to effectively study data across the <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/startup-metrics.html">five major metrics</a> (AARRR) for start-ups:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Acquisition:</em> the cost of acquiring first-time users</li>
<li><em>Activation:</em> the speed at which clients are becoming active, including events, in addition to various actions on the website</li>
<li><em>Retention:</em> the ability to retain a client who is engaged in the service - they make purchases and are basically a source of recurring revenue</li>
<li><em>Referral:</em> rate at which people are inviting others to the site, as well as the rate at which the invitees yield to the invitations and actually visit the site</li>
<li><em>Revenue:</em> first point of purchase as far as the client is concerned.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these metrics is important and it is therefore essential that an eye be kept on them to recognize when changes need to be made. A cohort analysis enables one to do just that, without using multiple tools.</p>

<h2>Facilitating speedy Decision Making</h2>

<p>A cohort analysis also helps in identifying times when engagement in the site drops. Since it is a study that takes time into consideration, decisions can be made fast in an effort to rectify the problem areas that may have resulted in the drop. By factoring-in time, there is a clear temporal sequence when analyzing the relationship between first contact with the website, and consequent results.</p>

<hr />

<p>The video below illustrates how a cohort analysis is performed. In my opinion Excel is the best tool to use for cohort analysis as it&#8217;s much easier than say Mixpanel or Kissmetrics - plus you get your hands dirty and (hopefully) gain an understanding of your data. Although, I really do like <a href="http://blog.rjmetrics.com/see-what-drives-repeat-business-in-your-rjmetrics-online-dashboard/">RJMetrics</a> for cohort analysis as well.</p>

<p>In the video, dummy data has been used on the premise that the business has been operating for an entire year.</p>

<p>That said the data has been generated from real data, which I obtained using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. With Zapier, you can easily source data from hundreds of locations like <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/2012/09/18/making-salesforce-work-with-your-favorite-apps/">Salesforce</a>, ZenDesk, Zoho, MySQL, and <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/2012/07/01/shopify-integrations-boost-retention-increase-upsales-and-provide-killer-customer-support/">Shopify</a>.</p>

<p>The video begins with showing you how to divide the users of a service into cohorts, based on the time that they first subscribed for the services. The retention rate has also been included. These values are obtained by dividing the number of users, who are still subscribing after a particular month, by the total number of users who started in each category. The average retention rate is therefore obtained by calculating the average across the cohort.</p>
