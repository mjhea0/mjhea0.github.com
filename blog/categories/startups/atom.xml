<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Okay. So you’re a newly proclaimed entrepreneur, e.g. - someone who will do everything in their power to be sure their company succeeds. You have a breakthrough product idea but you are not completely sure how to go about running the business side of launching said product. You know you want to be as efficient and as quick as possible in building a following and getting your product out there, yet you only have so much time and money. So how do you do it?</p>

<p>Work tirelessly to create your product and launch it as soon as possible? Not exactly. In fact, you want to do the opposite: Work in reverse. It might seem counterintuitive, but trust me, you will thank me in the end. By using the tools and methods below, the process will become clear.</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>

<p>First things first, make sure to start off with simplicity in mind. You want to keep this process <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">lean</a>. Try to eliminate the need for your team to <a href="http://mherman.org/blog/2013/08/02/multitasking-vs-batching/">multitask</a> too often. You don’t want anyone spreading themselves too thin and not doing their absolute best on a project. Keep it simple. Get things done one at a time and don’t move on to a new project until your current one is done. You can use a whiteboard or spreadsheets or a project management tool like <a href="https://asana.com">Asana</a> or <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> to keep track of projects in the brainstorm, in progress, or completed phases. Keep it organized. A benefit to this way of working is that every team member takes part in every aspect of working through a project and everyone gets to learn to think critically about a feature in the brainstorm column.</p>

<p>Will it be validated? If the answer is NO, don’t bother building it! Save the time, money, and stress. <em>Channel those resources into projects that will be validated</em>.</p>

<h2>Validation</h2>

<p>Now, you need to make sure your idea is valid, that what you have to offer is something people need and something that people want. But how do you know if that’s what you have? Test it. In business, especially in the world of startups, everything is an experiment and everything is a test. You’ve just become an entrepreneur, and congratulations, you’re also now a scientist.</p>

<p>You first want to determine what risks are involved with launching your product, service or idea - <a href="http://starterfinancialmodel.com">monetary risk</a>, time risk, etc. - and then determine the profit you’ll acquire from each sale.  When your benefits (profit) outweigh costs (risk), the company should grow. After determining your risks and profits and looking at how they balance out, decide if this idea will be “the one”.</p>

<p>Fortunately, when testing your profit (benefit-cost), you don’t need a huge number of customers to do so. Ten customers will provide the information you need so you don’t have to worry about thousands of customers in order to determine your potential test rate. That said, data changes, as well as your product and customers. What works now may not work in six weeks. Continue to source data for analysis to see if you are growing. Amazon's <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Mechanical Turk</a> is perfect for such testing at a low cost.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>

<p>How do you operate with limited financial, time, or labor resources? It just means you have to work smart. For example, rather than talking in circles with your team about the minute details of your product, look more at the testing. See if the product is even going to sell before you use those minimal resources to build it. Learn before you build and grow and do it quickly, especially if you have a small amount of time to get things done. Launch a landing page, watch the analytics, make changes, and launch again. Talk to your customers as much as you can, run <a href="http://mherman.org/blog/2012/11/16/the-benefits-of-performing-a-cohort-analysis-in-determining-engagement-over-time/#.Ut2aNmTn8y4">cohort analyses</a> if you have enough data, and hold focus groups. Take advantage of every opportunity you have to test your product.</p>

<p>Learn as much as you can directly from the source, your customers.</p>

<p>Now all that information might seem abstract and you want the step-by-step process of growing your business, so here we go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, determine and create the hype about your product. The product doesn’t have to be ready to launch by any means, though. That might seem counter-intuitive because wouldn’t you want to sell something that’s been created rather than selling just an idea? No. <em>You want to create a product you know is going to be successful - one that brings in sales - rather than wasting time making a product that fails.</em></p></li>
<li><p>In order to measure the demand for your idea, create a simple online landing page with <a href="http://launchrock.co/">LaunchRock</a>. Include your product idea, why it would be ideal to purchase this product. Which problems are you trying to solve? And how awesome this product is. Don’t hold back, you’re trying to sell something. After creating the landing page use web analytics (great <a href="http://blog.intlock.com/tracking-real-funnels-mixpanel-vs-kissmetrics-vs-google-analytics/">tools</a> are available for this) to see how many visits to the site you are getting and then take it one step further and look at how many people are interested in purchasing your product, those who try to move onto the second page of your site after they register for the mailing list). If there’s high interest, great! If it’s not what you expected, you can modify the product or throw in the towel completely.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve tested and retested the validity of your product, it’s time to start building it (since, after all, you told your customer base that it existed). Again, you want to be focus on developing rapidly: Don’t build anything unnecessary. Focus on your key differentiators and/or disruptors. Build what’s useful, iteratively. And don’t leave anything to chance!</p></li>
<li><p>If you make a change, test it. A great way to test a change is to run a double blind study (commonly known as an A/B test). Gather people to test, giving half the original product (A), and the other have the updated product (B) - and observe! See which product gets a better response and go with it. Pay attention to what people do (body language, facial expressions and the like) rather than what they say as people may not be as honest as you’d like them to be.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Measure</h2>

<p>It’s built! It’s launched! Is it successful?</p>

<p>Your reports need to be able to show you if something went wrong, either what went wrong or who you can talk to in order to figure that out, learn from it, and improve the issue. Next, reports need to be able to convince others so they must be accurate. This means use your clients and test subjects as actual data points. Don’t massage the data to make it look nice in order give you the results you want - you're only hurting yourself. Once your report gets too complicated, there’s more room for error and it becomes less convincing and less accurate. Lastly, it needs to be available to and easily understood by everyone so that they can learn from the data as well.</p>

<h2>Sustainable growth</h2>

<p>We are now going to look at how to sustain growth within your company and more specifically, what type of business model you are working with in order to grow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is your company going to grow solely by word of mouth, where each customer will then bring in new customers due to satisfaction with your product?</li>
<li>Will the profit from your customers help pay for advertising to increase sales and eventually fund your company?</li>
<li>Or will customers continue to purchase your product for long periods of time, increasing the lifetime value of each customer?</li>
</ol>


<p>Each of these mechanisms provides a means for sustainable growth where the acquisition of new customers stems from the actions of prior customers. Sustainable growth is the best way for a company, especially startups, to flourish. Again, <a href="http://blog.intlock.com/tracking-real-funnels-mixpanel-vs-kissmetrics-vs-google-analytics/">cohort analysis</a> is imperative here.</p>

<h2>Fail</h2>

<p>One important thing to remember in this venture is that you won’t get everything right the first time or second or third … and that’s ok. That’s not your job. You want to empower your employees without applying too much pressure, which is very hard to do. Really, to empower with minimal pressure is to admit to yourself, your team and everyone around you, that mistakes will be made. Just be sure to learn from them. Failure in business is expected - and encouraged. (How else are you going to learn?)</p>

<p>Messing something up gives you a chance to learn and grow your company by improving, learning, and building your intuition for what will and won't work. It’s almost to your benefit to mess up now and again.</p>

<hr>


<h4>So that’s it. If you take anything from this post let it be this:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Keep everything simple;</li>
<li>Always test, build, and measure;</li>
<li>Test as much as you can in order to validate that with what you’re working on; and</li>
<li>Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Now go be an entrepreneur. </strong></p>

    <id>http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2013/09/07/whats-the-difference-between-a-pre-order-and-an-mvp</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may have a great idea for a product but no money to actually produce it. You could attempt to raise funding from investors, but then you'll have to give up a significant portion of what you might earn from your product (and control). Offering your customers a chance to fund the production of what you're selling can help you get your product out into the world, and still make some money in the process. Even better, a pre-order can effectively show you if there's a demand for what you want to build. If not enough people are prepared to pre-order your product, you can cancel the project and move on to something that makes more sense.</p>

<p>In that way, a pre-order shares some characteristics with a minimum viable product. Both will help you establish the long-term viability of a product, before you invest too much effort in building it.</p>

<h2>Pre-Orders Are Easy to Do</h2>

<p>You can start a pre-order for a product with nothing more than a landing page and a payment processor. And you don't have to have technical skills to set up either: crowd-funding platforms are essentially generators for pre-order pages. Sites like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a> are a great way to sell a product before it's actually created, especially since most sites prefer campaigns for products where production is the only step left to complete.</p>

<p>The downside to pre-orders is that your potential customers have to trust that you'll be able to follow through on what you've promised. Even on big crowd-funding sites, where projects are vetted thoroughly, there have been plenty of situations where companies just weren't able to deliver on what they promised during the fundraising process.</p>

<h2>Why an MVP Still Makes Sense</h2>

<p>The real concern with offering a pre-order, rather than a minimum viable product, is that you can't easily prove that you can build the product you're offering. A minimum viable product shows your customers that you can put together exactly what you're offering — as well as proving to you that your approach to putting together your larger product will most likely work.</p>

<p>If you know exactly what you're doing and the only factor you want to test is whether there is a market for what you're offering, a pre-order makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, a minimum viable product may be a better approach, even if it does require more investment of your time upfront.</p>

    <id>http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2013/06/28/less-is-more</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>"The average attention span in 2012    was 8 seconds"</em></p>

<p>That means you have only a few seconds to grab a customer's attention. It's all about first impressions and fast impressions. As soon as they click on your website or come into your store they want to know what you do, and how you do it. You need to keep options simple.</p>

<p>Too many options can overwhelm a customer. If you are offering  too many products or services the customer can not grasp what your business is really about. Again, you only have so long to keep their attention. If those few seconds are spent on trying to figure out what you really are offering than you will not convert that customer into a sale. That is why <em>Less is More</em>. A clear defined product, in a clear defined industry will keep them interested.</p>

<p>Sometimes this can be a hard fact to swallow. You want to offer everything you can. You want to capitalize on every opportunity you can. It's great to have options, but when those options take a completely different direction, you will lose the customer. Too much unnecessary noise will distract the customer from your most important products or services. Stick to what you do BEST. This will make you the go to company for that niche item.</p>

<p>Remember it is okay to minimize your offer list. Let the customers attention be pushed towards fewer options. This will give them more time to focus on what the product or service does and how it will benefit them to have it. Eliminate the excess variables in the equation. It will make it much easier to make sure that you are meeting the customers needs and wants.</p>

<p>You need to keep your brand in mind at all times. What is your company about? Are all your products and services in line with the brand you are trying to promote. You want customers to have a clear view of what you do and what you offer. Brand extension needs to be strategic. For example, Burger King added underwear to their product list, Paula Deen selling kid's furniture, or Zippo lighters trying to add women's perfume to their brand. None of these make sense, make sure that the products you are offering are limited to ones that make sense! Do not start offering all of these extra items. Stick to what your company is good at, keep the customer focused on your best products or services. Do not distract them with other unnecessary offers.</p>

<p>It is like going to a restaurant and opening a 5 page menu with way too many options. You feel overwhelmed. You start wondering that if they make everything, is anything actually good? You just want to close the menu and go somewhere simpler. Do not let your customers feel like this. Make those 8 seconds you get of their attention count.</p>
